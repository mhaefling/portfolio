  - title: About Me
    description: 
      - Hi, I’m Matt Haefling — a husband, brother, dog and cat dad, and proud homeowner. I’m currently transitioning into software development after more than a decade of working in customer service roles. My love for technology began early; I earned my CompTIA A+ certification shortly after high school and have always had a fascination with computers, how they work, and how they can be used to solve everyday problems.
      - Over the years, I worked at companies like Progressive Insurance, T-Mobile, and Keysight Technologies. In those roles, I developed strong communication and problem-solving skills, becoming especially skilled at active listening, troubleshooting, multitasking, and de-escalation. At T-Mobile, I moved into a leadership support role as a Senior Account Expert, where I mentored colleagues and helped streamline call experiences by identifying common customer pain points.

    description: 
      - During my time in customer service, I noticed a recurring theme. Many customer frustrations stemmed from software limitations and poor user experience — not just human error. That realization inspired me to shift gears and pursue a career in software development.
      - Over the past two years, I’ve earned my CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications through dedicated self-study and began immersing myself in programming. I’m especially interested in building software that’s intuitive, user-focused, and genuinely helpful — tools that reduce confusion and make workflows more efficient. I believe my deep understanding of customer needs gives me a unique perspective when it comes to creating meaningful, user-centered software solutions.

    description: 
      - Outside of tech, I’m a big fan of the outdoors and hands-on work. I love hiking, working out, and building and repairing custom PCs and electronics. Whether I’m troubleshooting a line of code or fixing a busted GPU, I enjoy the process of learning how things work and finding practical solutions to problems.

    description: 
      - As I grow my skills as a software developer, I’m also looking ahead to my long-term goal, working in web application security. I want to bring together my knowledge of networking, cybersecurity, and development to help build safer, more secure digital platforms.
      - I hope to join a company that empowers its employees to keep learning, growing, and innovating — and one that takes user privacy and data security seriously. Ultimately, I want to contribute to software that not only works well but protects the people who use it.
