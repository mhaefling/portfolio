      - Hi, I’m Matt Haefling, a software developer with a passion for solving complex problems and creating efficient, user-friendly solutions. My journey into tech comes after more than 13 years in fast-paced customer service roles, where I developed skills in active listening, multitasking, troubleshooting, and de-escalation. Through these experiences, I saw firsthand how software limitations and miscommunication often led to customer frustration—so I decided to be part of the solution.
